### ⚠️ **Known Issues (Expected in Development)**

#### 🚰 **Devnet Airdrop Limitations**
```
Error: Rate limit exceeded. The devnet faucet has a limit of 1 SOL per project per day.
```
**Status:** Expected limitation - not a bug
**Solution:** Use different wallets or wait 24 hours
**Impact:** No impact on UI testing

#### 🔧 **Smart Contract Initialization**
```
Error Code: AccountNotInitialized. The program expected this account to be already initialized.
```
**Status:** Presale contract needs initialization
**Solution:** Admin needs to run initialization scripts
**Impact:** Demo mode activated for seamless testing

#### 🌐 **RPC Endpoint Issues**
```
403: Rate limit exceeded
```
**Status:** Using public RPC endpoints
**Solution:** Upgrade to paid Helius plan for production
**Impact:** Temporary - fallbacks in place

### 🎮 **How to Test the Application**

#### **1. Connect Wallet**
- Click "Connect Wallet" in the header
- Choose your preferred wallet (Phantom recommended)
- Allow connection

#### **2. Explore All Features**
- **Presale**: Try buying VIBES with SOL/USDC (demo mode)
- **Staking**: Test staking/unstaking flows (demo mode)
- **Vesting**: Create and manage vesting schedules (demo mode)

#### **3. Test Responsive Design**
- Resize browser window
- Test on mobile devices
- Check tablet layouts

#### **4. Verify Accessibility**
- Tab navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode

### 🔧 **For Development Team**

#### **Immediate Actions Needed:**
1. **Initialize Presale Contract**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to smart contract project
   cd /Users/osmelprieto/Projects/vibe-smart-contract
   
   # Run presale initialization
   npm run init:presale
   ```

2. **Set Up Helius RPC (Optional)**
   ```bash
   # Get API key from helius.xyz
   # Update .env.local with your key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_HELIUS_RPC_ENDPOINT=https://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_KEY
   ```

3. **Disable Demo Mode (When Ready)**
   ```typescript
   // In src/lib/config.ts
   export const DEMO_MODE = false;
   ```

#### **Status Banners Explained:**
- **⚠️ Development Mode Active**: Shows when demo mode is enabled
- **🚰 Airdrop Rate Limited**: Normal devnet limitation
- **🔧 Contract Not Initialized**: Expected until admin setup

### 📊 **Performance Metrics**

#### **Build & Performance**
