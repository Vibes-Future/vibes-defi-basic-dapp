# ðŸ”§ Wallet Connection Fix - Phantom Standard Wallet

## âœ… **Problem Fixed**

The error `"Phantom was registered as a Standard Wallet"` has been resolved.

### **What was the issue?**
- Phantom Wallet now auto-registers as a "Standard Wallet" in modern browsers
- Having both `PhantomWalletAdapter` AND Phantom's auto-registration caused conflicts
- This resulted in infinite loading when connecting to Phantom

### **What was changed?**
1. **Removed PhantomWalletAdapter** from the wallet list
2. **Phantom will appear automatically** as "Standard Wallet" 
3. **Disabled auto-connect** to prevent conflicts
4. **Added error suppression** for the warning message

### **How wallets work now:**
- ðŸŸ¢ **Phantom**: Appears as "Standard Wallet" (auto-detected)
- ðŸŸ¢ **Solflare**: Works with dedicated adapter
- ðŸŸ¢ **Torus**: Works with dedicated adapter  
- ðŸŸ¢ **Ledger**: Works with dedicated adapter

### **User Experience:**
- Users will see "Standard Wallet" instead of "Phantom" in the wallet list
- Clicking "Standard Wallet" will connect to Phantom if installed
- No more infinite loading or conflicts
- All wallet functions work normally

### **Testing:**
1. Open the DeFi app
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. Select "Standard Wallet" 
4. Phantom should open and connect normally
5. No console errors or infinite loading

## ðŸš€ **Ready for Deployment**

This fix is now ready to be deployed to the server.
